# DemoSetup
A basic project setup in VexCode

The goal of this repository is act as a clean "master" copy of a default setup in VexCode. This project is essentially a teamplate for getting setup quickly with a new robot.

Update all the variable in DriveFunctionsConfig.h to get started.

Motors that are not part of the drive train will need to be setup manually as usual.

Auton program swither is included. Put routines in Autons.Cpp and add them to the auton-support files
